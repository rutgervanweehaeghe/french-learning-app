      Pronunciation is one of the most distinctive features of the French language. 
      While English and French share many words of Latin origin, the way these words 
      are pronounced can be very different. Mastering French sounds requires attention 
      to vowels, nasal tones, rhythm, and intonation. 
    </p>

    <h2>1. Vowel Sounds</h2>
    <p>
      French vowels are generally <strong>purer</strong> than English vowels. In English, vowels often 
      become diphthongs (gliding from one vowel to another, as in “day” /deɪ/). 
      In French, vowels remain steady and short: <strong>é</strong> in <em>été</em> is a single sound /e/, 
      never sliding into another.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>é</strong> → /e/ (like “say” without the glide)</li>
      <li><strong>è</strong> → /ɛ/ (like “bed”)</li>
      <li><strong>u</strong> → /y/ (no English equivalent, lips rounded as if saying “oo” while tongue is in “ee” position)</li>
      <li><strong>o</strong> → /o/ or /ɔ/ (closed and open versions of “o”)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Nasal Vowels</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most famous differences is the French use of <strong>nasal vowels</strong>. 
      Sounds like <em>on</em>, <em>an</em>, <em>in</em>, and <em>un</em> are produced by allowing air to 
      pass through the nose as well as the mouth. English speakers often replace them 
      with an “n” sound, but in French the final “n” is usually silent.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>on</em> → /ɔ̃/ (as in <em>bonjour</em>)</li>
      <li><em>an</em> or <em>en</em> → /ɑ̃/ (as in <em>manger</em>)</li>
      <li><em>in</em> or <em>ain</em> → /ɛ̃/ (as in <em>vin</em>)</li>
      <li><em>un</em> → /œ̃/ (unique nasal sound with no English equivalent)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Consonant Differences</h2>
    <p>
      While many consonants are similar in English and French, there are some important differences:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The French <strong>r</strong> is pronounced in the throat (uvular /ʁ/), very different from the English “r”.</li>
      <li>The final consonant in many French words is <strong>silent</strong>: <em>parler</em> → /paʁ.le/ (the “r” is pronounced, but the “-er” ending is silent like “ay”).</li>
      <li><strong>h</strong> is always silent in French: <em>homme</em> → /ɔm/.</li>
      <li>The <strong>gn</strong> in French (as in <em>montagne</em>) is like the “ny” in “canyon”.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Linking and Liaison</h2>
    <p>
      In connected French speech, final consonants that are normally silent may be pronounced 
      if the next word begins with a vowel. This is called <strong>liaison</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: <em>les amis</em> → /lez‿ami/ (“s” links to the vowel, sounding like “z”).  
      In English, words are more clearly separated, but in French, liaisons create smoother flow.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Rhythm and Intonation</h2>
    <p>
      French is considered a <strong>syllable-timed language</strong>, meaning each syllable tends to have 
      equal length. English, by contrast, is <strong>stress-timed</strong>, meaning stressed syllables are longer 
      while unstressed ones are shorter. This makes French sound more “even” or “machine-like” to English speakers.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Intonation in French also tends to rise at the end of yes/no questions, 
      while falling more sharply at the end of statements compared to English.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Common Pronunciation Challenges for English Speakers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Producing the French <strong>r</strong> correctly without using an English accent.</li>
      <li>Keeping vowels <strong>pure</strong> without turning them into diphthongs.</li>
      <li>Mastering nasal vowels, especially distinguishing <em>an</em> /ɑ̃/ from <em>on</em> /ɔ̃/.</li>
      <li>Remembering to <strong>drop final consonants</strong> that are silent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Understanding French pronunciation requires practice and awareness of these differences. 
      By focusing on pure vowels, nasal tones, smooth liaisons, and the unique rhythm of the language, 
      learners can move closer to authentic French speech. Unlike English, French emphasizes clarity of vowel sounds 
      and a more regular rhythm, giving it its distinct musical quality.
